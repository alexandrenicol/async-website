Flat explores how to make it easy to work with data in git and GitHub. It builds on the [“git scraping” approach pioneered by Simon Willison][simon-willison] to offer a simple pattern for bringing working datasets into your repositories and versioning them, because developing against local datasets is faster and easier than working with data over the wire.
