The Web is over 30 years old, yet some websites are still not accessible.

This is the tale of how Alexa, with a little bit of help, came to the rescue of
a blind person who could not get access to local news.

In this talk, Alex Nicol speaks about accessibility, web crawling, tech for
good, Alexa, running Ruby on Lambdas, and working on a side project whilst
having a six-month-old baby.
